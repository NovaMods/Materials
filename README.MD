# Minecraft 1.1.1 Material Files
These are the material files used by Bedrock shaders in Minecraft 1.1.1. They tell Bedrock how to render certain objects by specifying, among other things, what shader files to use, how the vertex data shoudl be set up, the depth test and stencil test state, and much more. 

I've cloned these to the Nova Mods organization so they're available for Nova to use and modify
